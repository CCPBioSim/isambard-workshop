# ISAMBARD: A Python-based API for Biomolecular Structure Analysis and Parametric Design of Protein Structures

## Aimed at: 
Anyone interested in learning how to use the new ISAMBARD Python tools for structural analysis and rational design of proteins and biomolecules.

## Requirements: 
Knowledge of Python, e.g. as gained from the Python for Biomolecular Modellers workshops. The material from the Python workshops will be online and is self-study, in case you are not able to attend the workshop on Monday.

## Abstract: 
In this workshop we introduce ISAMBARD, an open-source Python package for structural analysis and rational design of biomolecules. ISAMBARD provides a generalised approach for modelling any parametrizable protein fold, as well as methods for optimizing and scoring models. In addition, it contains useful tools for the structural analysis of proteins. The practical workshop comprises three parts:

1. An introduction to structure representation in ISAMBARD through the AMPAL (Atom, Monomer, Polymer, Assembly, Ligand) framework. This will provide a basic overview of how to work with biomolecules in ISAMBARD, including selection and analysis of structural elements.
2. Modelling and analysis of coiled-coil structures. This will include parametric analysis of natural coiled coils to extract structural parameters, as well as creating models de novo using ISAMBARD specifications, which can be extended to allow users to create their own parameterisations.
3. Optimization of the structural parameters of models. We will give a brief introduction to meta-heuristics, basic optimization of parametric models and how to analyse and interpret the results.

To get the most out of the workshop, we recommend that you are comfortable with the fundamentals of the Python programming language and the Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Training Material

The workshop consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks. These are available
below, and can be run using the 
<a href="https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/bristol2018/server.html" target="_blank">workshop jupyter server</a>.

Once you have started the server, navigate to the `isambard_workshop` directory and you will find the
notebooks there.
